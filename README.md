# TaxJar A/B Design Test

I chose to A/B test the homepage hero section/above the fold to try and get a better conversion rate for the free trial. 

My thought process here is that upon landing on TaxJar.com I immediately looked to the top left of the screen at your logo to verify where I was. It seems a little uncomfortable for me to then diagonally move back to the center of the screen. My eye naturally wants to move straight down. I thought I would integrate a couple of design principles here to test my theory (the rule of thirds and the "F" layout).

By keeping all of the important information on the left third of the screen it is visually pleasing and it aligns the content with your brand logo - double win! I've read articles in the past where research concludes users eyes fall and scan a website in a "F" pattern. This alternate layout puts all the important information somewhere along that "F" shape.
